This a pet project. I am learning basics of Kotlin and Android Studio.
The calculator should have All Clear option, as well as be able to calculate full problems with parentheses.
Currently only the interface is ready, and I am planning to change it. I want to delete 'clear' button and only leave 'all clear'. Also planning to add 'delete' button.
